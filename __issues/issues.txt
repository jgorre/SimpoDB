Structure command handling somehow

Decide if we're going hardcore and doing some custom binary encoding/decoding thing on the files
    - Start with csv
    - Then switch out later
    - Use the starting with csv as a way to make it clear where writing/encoding/reading/decoding 
        code should be separated from other code. Should help with structure.
